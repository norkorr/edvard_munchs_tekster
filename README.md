# Edvard Munchs tekster
Website: [emunch.no](https://www.emunch.no/)

The website has been developed at the Munch Museum. It is a digital archive of material taken from the Munch collection in the Munch Museum. Essentially, the content consists of texts written by Edvard Munch and letters to and from Edvard Munch.

The collection of letters includes 4262 letters and drafts. We hope to include all of these in the NorKorr data set.

Unfortunately, the metadata for Munchâ€™s texts currently exist in conflicting versions.

The register files at the website have not been updated for almost two years because the website needs a technical update before it is possible to publish again.

Some of the offline register files have been updated (but not published) anticipating an update of the website. 
Metadata in the collection database are updated when new data are found. We are aware of differences between the metadata in the register files and those in the collection database. 

Currently, the museum is working with the dating of all letters and letter drafts from Munch, revising dates where necessary and dating previously undated letters where possible. The result of this work is for practical reasons temporarily registered in an Excel sheet but will be transferred to the collection database once the work is completed.

Obviously, we want to have only one version of the metadata, and we want that to be registered in the collection database. From there the metadata can be published via an API to the new version of emunch.no.

We are planning to collect all metadata in the collection database when we have the necessary in-house resources to do so, but until then we have a confusing metadata situation and the metadata themselves are inconsistent.
