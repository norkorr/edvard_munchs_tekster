# Edvard Munchs tekster
Website: [emunch.no](https://www.emunch.no/)

The website has been developed at the Munch Museum. It is a digital archive of material taken from the Munch collection in the Munch Museum. Essentially, the content consists of texts written by Edvard Munch and letters to and from Edvard Munch.

The collection of letters includes 4262 letters and drafts. We hope to include all of these in the NorKorr data set.
